Merge conflict- Dev A and Dev D work on common file test.txt. Both writing code in their own local copies. Dev A makes a push to file and same thing is pushed by Dev D. Might be Overlap.

Unix/bash command - `vi 'path'` Creates new file and opens in vim. Press i and select insert to add text. Esc -> shift + z + z to exit vim
`git branch` see how many branches you have

`git checkout -b feature-1`
git checkout (branch) branchName*Creates local branch*

`git push --set-upstream origin feature-1`
*Uploads local branch to server*

`git checkout main`
*switch branch to main*

`git merge feartue-1`
*Merge branch directly to main*

1 `git branch`
2 `git checkout -b branch-name`
3 `write changes to test.txt`
4 `git add test.txt`
5 `git commit -m 'message'`
6 `git push --set-upstream origin 'branch-name`

    h key to move to the left side.

    k key to move upside in the file.

    j key to move downside in the file.

    First column - total number of lines in the file
    Second column - total number words in file
    Third column - total number bytes in file
    Fourth column - file name

Copy files with `cp source_file destination_file` ex: `cp filename copyfile`
Rename files with `mv old_file new_file` ex: `mv filename newfile`
Delete files with `rm filename` or `rm filename filename2 filename3` to delete multiples
    Best to use -i alone with rm to confirm you want to delete the file in question. `rm -i fileToDelte`.

Standard Unix streams:
    stdin - standard input (file descriptor 0). Unix program will read standard input from STDIN
    stdout - standard output (file descriptor 1). Unix program will write the default output at STDOUT
    stderr - standard error (file descriptor 2). Unix will write all error messages at STDERR

DIRECTORIES
reference following section: <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-directories.htm>

A directory if a file that other ordinary files, special files, or directory files are stored in. Files in Unix are stores as a tree and have a root node at / and all other directories are contained below it.

Home directory - The directory you enter when you log in to a Unix system. Can travel to with `cd ~` command. Can traverse to another users home directory with `cd ~username`
Return to last directory with `cd -`

Absolue/Relative path names - Directories area arranged in a tree with / (root) at the top. Parts of a path name are seperated by /. A pathname is absolute when  described in relation to root. Ex of absolute path names: /etc/passwd  |  /users/sjones/chem/notes  |  /dev/rdsk/Os3
Pathnames can also be relative to your working directory. / is excluded from the beginning of relative pathnames. Ex: chem/notes  |  personal/res

To print working directory `pwd`
